Role Name
=========

A role to install Apache, open firewall ports and create a sample web-page.
Ansible features implemented in the task (not sure if this is needed in real life, just used them to accomplish the task):
- roles
- handlers
- variables
- ansible facts
- templates

Role Variables
--------------

Variables are for learning purpose only, stored at roles/task3_role/vars directory.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
